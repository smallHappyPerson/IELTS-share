# Bar chart

- show numbers changing over a period of time(just like line graphs)(you can draw the lines following the time)
- not always show time, they often only compare numbers(different items). compare the bars

- general comparison(overview,don't show the number)
- compare specific numbers(give the numbers)
- GROUP THE ITEMS TOGETHER
- High ones and low ones
