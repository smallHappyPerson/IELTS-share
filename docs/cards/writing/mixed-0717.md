Nowadays, people from many countries prefer wearing western-style clothes such as suits and jeans in daily life rather than their traditional ones. The reasons behind are complex and I believe to some extent it's a negative trend.

People's choices on clothes not only depend on the convenience of the object but also reflects the significant cultural influence western world has in modern time. First and foremost, western-style clothes such as shirts and jeans are widely adopted for that they are lighter and more convenient as daily clothes. For example, comparing to modern choices, traditional Chinese clothes are much more loose and complex and therefore less convenient for current fast-paced city life. Furthermore, this trend also shows the powerfulness of western world nowadays. Since western countries expanded widely across the globe several centuries ago, they have spreaded their own culture all over the world. Today, due to the advancement of their film industry, western-style life, including western food and western clothes, is popupar worldwide again.

From my perspective, despite the convenience of modern western-style clothes, certain risks of the wide preference to it cannot be neglected. To begin with, a unified outlook, which indicates a increasingly similar inner cultural motivation, has a great potential to harm the world's diversity. One factor that makes earth interesting is the diversity coming from all those independently developed civilizations, presenting various types of lifestyles. As the trend of the clothes unification grows, many dressing traditions of minority cultures are at risk. For example, in China, many people have never tried traditional ethnical clothes through their lives, which lowers their sense of identity.

In conclusion, people with different cultural backgrounds nowadays prefer western-style clothes for its convenience and a more advanced type of lifestyle it represents. However, I believe that if people don't pay attention to the preservation of their own dressing traditions, not only diversity of the civilization may be hurt, but people would also suffer from the loss of the sense of identity.
