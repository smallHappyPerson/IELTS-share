The diagram provides a description for the construction of a simple water filter and the way in which this filter produces drinkable clean water.

The main composition of this water filter can be divided into 6 parts. First, all the structures aimed at cleaning water are held in the a large main container with a lid. Second, the empty space in the upper part inside the container functions as a temperary holder for the impure water when it first enters this gadget. Below the empty part is a sand layer and down the sand layer there is a layer of charcoal. Then there's a gravel in the bottom of this container where a pipe allows the processed water to flow out of the container, into the last component, a tank outside the processing container which stores the drinking water.

The way in which this filter functions to produce cleam water can be illustrated by a use case. To use this facilitate, impure water is first poured into the processing container. After that, the water goes through the sand layer, where the solid impurities are filtered out. Then, the charcoal layer below captures the  impurities at an even finer level. Finally, the processed water goes down to the gravel at the bottom and arrives at the storage tank through a pipe which connects between the two containers.

To sum up, this water filter is consisted of 2 filter layers with different magnitude levels and impure water, after going through those layers, is pumped out from the processing container through a pipe into the final storage container.

- potable: water that is safe and suitable for drinking. has been purified
