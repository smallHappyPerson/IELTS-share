Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, some people think that they are the best people to talk to school students the danger of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?

After being put into prisons, many people who once committed crimes have realized and reconsidered their former misdeeds and became nice citizens later. I totally agree that they would be great teachers on educating teenagers about how close ordinary people can be to committing a crime.

On the one hand, those who truely realized their former mistakes have deeper understanding of how a crime would happen, which helps students be alerted when they encounter a crime or on the edge of committing a crime. Many crimes are not necessarily out of personal malice. Under most circumstances, people don't even realize until the terrible consequence is made. For example, a person controlled by alchohol might severely hurt others unconciously. However, if the prison life, which takes the guilty away from addicts, makes the person regret and be determined to change by bringing consiousness back to him, this person can definitely become a good citizen afterwards. Furthermore, some people, due to the absence of education and parenting, may have no concepts of the law, which makes them liable to touch the red line of the law. By clarifying the possible reasons behind unintended crimes, these people can explain how close normal person can be to crimes and promote students' awareness of law systems.

On the other hand, people like them also show the successful operation of the current law system which strengthens adolescents' belief in the society and the possibility of starting a new life after a crime as long as this person has gone through the punishment he or she deserved. Since teenager-committed crimes are increasingly a concerned issue, this could be especially meaningful for young students who might accidentally have done something terrible and become too scared to request help due to a lack of relevant knowledge. However, trying to keep crimes a secret can only lead to more tragic consequences by attempts to cover, even having the potential of ruining a young person's personality. After being informed of the law system and developing faith in their future life, it's more likely for teenagers to reach out for help when something bad happens.

In conclusion, it's a brilliant idea to educate students about laws and crimes through speeches given by former prisoners. Not only do they understand deeply how crimes happen, but they themselves can also function as a showcase of modern law systems and reveal the possiblity of being a new person towards teenagers who have already gone through tough situations.
