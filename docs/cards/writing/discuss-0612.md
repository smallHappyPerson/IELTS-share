In developing countries, some people think the government should introduce new technology to people in order to improve quality of life, while others believe governments should offer free education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

---

To offer people in developing countries a life with higher quality, some people believe importing new technology is essential, while others argue that free education provided by governments is more demanding. From my perspective, both these ideas are practicable and significant on this issue, for that new technology benefits people's daily lives immediately while free education promises the aspiring future.

Higher productivity and better health care is the least what new technology can offer. New technology boosts productivity, which is essential for a country to accumulate wealth and thereby improve citizen's lives. For example, before the Industry Revolution, most farming was done by human farmers, whose limitations lead to the fact that the productivity was inadequate and people would die from starving even they worked extremely hard. That situation changed after machine-dominated agriculture was introduced, which allowed tireless machines do the job and large scale farming, which once seemed impossible, became reality. What's more, better medical technology also contributed to the well-beings of humans living in modern society. Without those miraculous technology, human beings would not have had their average life-span prolonged so much.

Not only does free education contributes to a better personal life, but is also indispensable to cultivate future citizens for a ideal society, thus in the end benefiting individuals. First of all, the right to receive education is fundamental human right. As individuals, having basic knowledge about the world, such as literacy and simple math operations, is important. And free education offered by government grants residents that opportunity, regardless of their personal background. If people don't have access to free education, those who belongs to poor families, which takes a large proportion of population in developing countries, might never have the chance to get any. On a society level, an ideal society is expected to have virtues like harmony and intelligence, which can be brought by education. Education gives people the concept of society and teaches them to treasure friendship and family, which has the potential to form a more friendly society where people enjoy peaceful and delightful life. Technology development can also benefit from free education. With more population having the sense of science, more ideas are likely to be thought up, thus improving people's daily life.

In conclusion, both new technology and free education is vital if a developing country is interested in improving people's life quality. And none of them should be neglected.
