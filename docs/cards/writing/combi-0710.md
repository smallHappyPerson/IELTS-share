In both Q1 and Q2 of 2014, the average ticket price in this theatre was about 9.25 euros, which rose drastically to 10.5 euros when the Q3 of 2014 comes. After that, this figure remained almost unchanged until the end of 2015 except for the temperory drop of about 0.3 euros in the third quarter of 2015.
