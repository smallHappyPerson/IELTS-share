The two diagrams illustrate and predict the development of automotive number and the amount of CO2 emission in England and Wales from 2000 to 2020.

The vehicle number in England and Wales saw a steady growth from 2000 to 2015. And this figure is expected to keep growing till 2020. Meanwhile, among all types of vehicles, the main part of CO2 emission comes from cars, following by trucks, vans and buses.

In 2000, traffic level in England and Wales was 20 millions. After 5 years, this figure reached 30 millions. After a constant rise in the following 10 years, by 2015, vehicle number in this area has reached 50 millions, with an average growing rate of about 2 millions per year. What's more, this figure is predicted to keep increasing during 2015 and 2020. According to the forecast, the automotive number in England and Wales will be over 60 millions by 2020.

Among all kinds of vehicles, cars produce the largest amount of CO2 emission, followed by trucks, vans and buses, with cars taking most of the proportion. This situation has remained the same from 2000 to 2010 and is predicted to stay unchanged until 2020. From 2000 to 2010, the amount of CO2 emission coming from cars increased from 2 tonnes to about 2.7 tonnes, with a projection of 3 tonnes to 2020. This figure of trucks also rose from 0.7 tonnes in 2000 to 0.9 tonnes in 2010 and is expected to keep rising to 1.3 tonnes by 2020. Meanwhile, the amount of CO2 emission produced by buses and vans both saw a slight rise from 2000 to 2010, with the figure of buses rising from 0.25 tonnes to 0.4 tonnes and that of vans 0.5 tonnes to 1.25 tonnes. And these 2 figures are predicted to stay stable during 2010 and 2020.

Among all kinds of vehicles, cars produce the largest amount of CO2 emission, followed by trucks, vans and buses, with cars taking most of the proportion. This situation has remained the same from 2000 to 2010 and is predicted to stay unchanged until 2020. From 2000 to 2010, the amount of CO2 emission coming from cars increased from 2 tonnes to about 2.7 tonnes, with a projection of(**with a projected rise to**) 3 tonnes ~~to~~==by== 2020. **Similarly**, This figure ~~of~~==for== trucks also rose from 0.7 tonnes in 2000 to 0.9 tonnes in 2010 and is expected to keep rising to 1.3 tonnes by 2020. **Meanwhile**, the amount of CO2 emission produced by buses and vans both saw a slight rise from 2000 to 2010(**over the same period**), with the figure ~~of~~==for== buses rising from 0.25 tonnes to 0.4 tonnes and that of vans ==from== 0.5 tonnes to 1.25 tonnes. And these 2 figures are predicted to stay stable ~~during~~==between== 2010 and 2020. **this trend is expected to stay constant**
