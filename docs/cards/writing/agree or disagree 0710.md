some people think governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---

Governments are expected to focus on eliminating environmental pollution and addressing housing problems to protect citizens from illness and disease. I totally agree with this idea.

To promote people's health conditions, reducing pollution is indispensable. To begin with, with modern industry developing rapidly worldwide, more and more insufficiently processed industrial wastes are being poured into the nature, posing an increasingly severe threat to inhabitats of all creatures. For instance, the microplastics generated in the process of manufacturing, after entering seas, are likely to be absorbed by fishes thus entering the predator chain, which have great potential to end up in human's bodies eventually, causing unexpected health-related consequences. Governments, which are liable to enact and enforce laws and regulations for tax-payers' benefits, should definitely inspect and deal with these underlying risks.

Since people nowadays suffer from housing problems, governments should take the responsibility and work out a feasible solution, thus contributing to residents' well-being. First and foremost, housing is a necessary demand for people to survive in modern society. Without a proper residential condition, people may have trouble studying or working as usual. For example, in lack of quiet environment to sleep, students or workers will constantly live under stress, anxiety and tireness, which destoys individuals' physical and mental health and does no good for the society at the same time. What's more, it's also not rare to find worrying problems in existing houses such as construction risks, toxic gases coming from decorating materials and water suppliment, which sacrifices people's life quality. Facing these problems, among all the entities involved, the measurements taken by governments to regulate contracters and relevant companies can be most effective and fruitful.

In conclusion, to guard residents' health, it's necessary for governments to focus on environmental and housing conditions, given that modern industry brings more environmantal challenges than ever and that unpleasent housing conditions have extremely negative impacts on citizens.
