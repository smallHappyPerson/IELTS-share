- 小作文，==时态要统一==
1. 小作文：我看的都说overview写两句，所以可以多写几句吗
	1. 一定要写==明显特征==，多谢也可以
3. 小作文：我凭感觉用时态，感觉有的时候我是在“现在正描述这个图表”就没有用过去时，但是我觉得“我正描述图表里表示的那个时间点”的时候，就用了过去时。。这个好难把握
	1. 看==图里面有没有明确的时间==，如果没有的话就都用现在时

The line graph illustrates the domestic sales of three different ==categories== of books during a ==4-year span== from 2002 to 2006 within a country.

These four years have seen a considerable rise in the sales of children's books and meanwhile, a drop of similar scale in that of adult's fictions. The sales figure of adult's fictions, which once was the top of all 3 types back in 2002, was taken over by that of children's book and educational books respectively in 2003 and 2006, making itself the bottom in the end.

In 2002, adult's fiction was the best-seller with a sales ==figure== of 45 million dollars, while none of the figures of other two reached 35 million dollars. That situation changed, though, in 2003, when the sales ==earnings== of children's books took over the top position of adult's fiction by an advantage of around 5 million dollars, and remained the top for the following 3 years during which its sales figure kept roaring and exceeded 55 million dollars in 2006. Meanwhile, the sales figure of adult's fictions saw a consistent decline through the 4 years, from 45 million dollars in 2002 to 30 million dollars in 2006, ==which included== a slight rise of about 4 million dollars in 2004 ==but still failed== to revert the falling trend.

The sales number of educational book remained stable comparing to the other two types which both have a noticable trend. In 2002, 2004 and 2005, the sales figure of educational book was about 25 million dollars, which seems to be a common case. However, ==from 2005 to 2006, this number saw a rise== of about 8 million dollars, which enabled educational books to ==rank the second place== that formerly belonged to adult's fictions by a small gap of no more than 3 million dollars. For educational books, however, rise of this scale was once seen in 2003, when the number dropped back to basic line in the following year immediately.
