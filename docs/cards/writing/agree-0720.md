> It is important for everyone, including young people, to save money fortheir future. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Many people believe that it is significant for everyone to save money for their future life, including young people. I personally agree with this idea. However, I believe people's choices in terms of money saving might depend more on local policies.

People need to save money not only for possible accidents in future, but also for the financial freedom they would like to have when it comes to shopping or investment. First and foremost, bad luck could happen to anyone. Unexpected issues such as car accidents and diseases are likely to destroy people's lives if they lack the economic ability to pay for the medical bills, which makes money saving a wise choice. Furthermore, except for accidents, people's necessary expenditure also entails large amount of money which requires a long-time accumulation for ordinary employees. For instance, without a certain amount of savings, people would be unable to buy a house or a car, while specific properties are required if they consider applying for a loan from banks. Also, personal plans such as travelling abroad are likely to be canceled due to a limited budget.

However, these needs mentioned above might be less urgent in some specific societies where policies guarantee a basic lifestyle without a rigorous money saving strategy. For example, in mainland of China, employees are required to pay not only for taxes but also for obligated social insurances and medical insurances, which means when accidents happen, citizens can count on governments fundings other than their own savings. Meanwhile, in HongKong, China, citizens don't have to pay mandatory insurances, which seemingly increased their income. However, when accidents happen, residents need to rely more on their own money, which leads to the fact that many HK citizens decide to buy insurances themselves.

In conclusion, I agree that people should have a money saving plan to prepare for future issues. But I also agree that with relevant policies in place, money saving may not be that important for some citizens.
