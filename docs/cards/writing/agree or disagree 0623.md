The news media have become more influential in people's lives, some people think it's a negative development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---

The news media are playing an increasingly significant role in people's daily lives, which sparked some people's concern of its negative effects. From my perspective, the rising news media, even given many of its potential risks, could bring more beneficial influences to modern society than the negative ones.

Admittedly, the power of news media, once utilized in an inappropriate way, can result in unwanted consequences. For example, under the pressure of earning profits for the investors, news media practitioners might choose to focus on those eye-catching headlines instead of caring about the issues which actually matters and deserves public attention. Furthermore, the fact that news media can easily influence the focus of the crowds gives it a great potential to be used as a tool to manipulate people's mind, thus gaining secret benefits without the public knowing what's behind the curtain. However, those drawbacks are not instinct in news media the concept itself. In contrast, if it's guaranteed that practitioners follows the professional ethical principals and keeps a heartfelt care for the society, the news media industry can contribute more to the well-being and the development of the society other than presenting hazard to it.

Meanwhile, the role that news media is playing in the modern society is indispensable and necessary. First and foremost, people nowadays care about strangers far away from them and are curious about different kinds of lives all around the world. And news media provide the window for that. Meanwhile, with the information technology developing rapidly and data generated every day increasing at an astronomical speed, citizens need news media to filter the trivial noises and provide an overall picture of the important news. Lastly, the boost of personal media channels is bringing innumerable more animated but also less liable stories to people's eyes, which on the contrary highlights the significance of the traditional news media that employs professional columnists who are trained academically and aimed at providing authentic descriptions and different points of views.

In conclusion, despite the underlying risks of the news media industry, with news media functioning well, the fact that people are putting more attention on them can be positive for that news media provide a channel to understand the world in a more unbiased, concise and authentic way with the efforts of professionals.
