The charts and the pie illustrate the number of college students in a particular country in Europe, the government's yearly education budget  per student from 1984 to 2009, and the proportion of students with various economic family backgrounds.

Generally, the number of students attending university experienced a relatively steady rise from 1984 to 2009, while the governments' annual spending on each student saw a considerable drop during the same period. Meanwhile, most of these college students came from high income families, while no obvious difference in terms of proportion can be noticed between those from low income families and that from middle income families.

From 1984 to 1989, the number of university students increased from about 160,000 to over 150,000, following by a drop to around 220,000 in 1994. However, after a sharp rise to 350,000 from 1994 to 1999, this figure experienced continuous increase until the last year, reaching 400,000 in 2009. 

Meanwhile, as the number of students increased from 1984 to 1989, the government's support for each of them drop from 14500 to 12500, which rose to 13000 when the student number fell in 1994. After that, with the college student number increasing steadily, the government's annual spending per student experienced a sharp drop, reaching merely 11000 in 2004. This figure, however, rose in 2009 to about 12000 while the student number continued rising. 

At last, university students coming from high income families accounts for over 50% of the whole group, while the proportion of students from low income families and middle income families was close, with a figure of about 26% for the former one and about 22% for the latter. This might be related to the continuously dropping government's annual education budget on each student.
