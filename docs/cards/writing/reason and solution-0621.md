> [!QUESTION]
> Many people do not feel safe either at home or they are out. What are the causes, and what can be done to make people feel safer?

---

Several reasons account for the feeling of unsafety inside and outside their homes among many people. To improve this situation, efforts from both governments, media, corporations and individuals are needed.

People in modern society suffer from the anxiety caused by possibly underlying risks within daily lives and it's not only governments, media and corporations, but also citizens themselves to be blamed. First and foremost, for governments, inadequate enforcement of regulations and laws might encourage a burst of crime for that illegal conducts stop to cost criminals much, which will definitely increase residents' concern. Furthermore, the preference of media to unusually horrible crimes also contributes to citizens' anxiety. Meanwhile, people living in information era also face the insecurity brought by the invasion of privacy and have a feeling of being spied on all day, which makes the situation even worse. Last but not least, the development in transportation technology and the enhancement of international communication are bringing people from totally different cultural background and financial situation closer than ever. And difference leads to misunderstanding and disagreement, which have a potential to end up in conflicts, threatening citizens' normal lives.

To increase people's feeling of being safe and protected, joint efforts are needed. To begin with, relevant government departments should play their role of enforcing regulations well, ensuring that illegal conducts get reasonable verdict according to the law without overusing their power. What's more, journalism practitioners are supposed to follow specific ethical principals other than focusing on getting residents' attention to make earnings using only eye-catching cases. Meanwhile, internet technology companies and electronical device manufacturers should emphasize the significance of customers' privacy protection. For individuals, adopting better safety systems might seems most practicable. However, from my perspective, it's people's attempts to truely understand and trust each other the real remedy which eliminates malice and conflicts in societies.

In conclusion, governments, media, corporations and individuals should all take responsibility on the issue of society safety. Only with efforts made by them all can it be possible for this problem to be solved.
