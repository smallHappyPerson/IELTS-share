The diagram illustrates the producing process of a biofuel named ethanol.

In general, ethanol is a renewable fuel, with carbon dioxide recycled during the process of its production and consumption. The source of ethanol production is plants and sunlight while its consumers are mostly vehicles and airplanes.

The production of ethanol starts from the growth of plants and trees, which acquires energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide. After harvesting, materials coming from plants are pre-processed using a specific machine to form cellulose, which turns into sugars after a series of chemical processing. Then, with microbes added, sugars are finally transformed into ethanol through biochemical reactions.

After being produced, ethanol functions as a fuel for both vehicles and airplanes, which generate carbon dioxide during their travel. Lastly, the carbon dioxide produced from the fuel consumption is released into air, which in return contributes to the growth of the source of ethanol, forests, completing the renewable production process of ethanol.
