The bar chart illustrates the changes in the locations where people from the UK used to browse webpages in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004.

During the 6-year span, British citizens visit the Internet mostly from home. The percentage of people surfing the Internet from work experienced a continuous decline from 1998 to 2004. Meanwhile, the proportion of people who request the Internet from college or library stayed comparatively stable.

In 1998, the percentage of people in the UK accessing the Internet from home was over 50%, ranking first among all the four venues including home, work, college and library. What's more, despite the drop of about 5% it went through from 1998 to 2000, this figure kept its leading position throughout all the 6 years, reaching about 55% in 2004.  Meanwhile, the second ranking location for surfing the Internet in 1998 was work place, with nearly 30% people reporting to have done that. However, this figure saw a steady drop from 1998 to 2004, reaching merely 10% in 2004.

The percentage of interviewees who claim to surf the Internet from their colleges remained stable from 1998 to 2002, with a figure of about 20%, while in 2004, this figure experienced a slight drop to about 18%. Furthermore, as the figure for people visiting the Internet from work dropped continuously, its second place was took by the figure for college in 2002 by an advantage of about 4%. Lastly, in all the 4 years, although can be assumed as stable, only less than 15% of the people reported to have surfed the Internet from a library.
