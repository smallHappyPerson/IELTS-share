Nowadays, more and more jobs and task are done by machines which involve hard physical work. Do these effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?

---

Increasing number of physically demanding jobs are being done by machines instead of human workers in modern society. From my perspective, this trend has more benefits than drawbacks.

Admittedly, replacing human workers with machines in any areas can have disadvantages, among which the most concerned problem is unemployment caused directly by it. Usually, business owners would prefer machines for their efficiency and low price, which motivates them to ==dismiss== their former employees in pursuit of machine-dominant manufacturing for long-term profit, leaving those employees jobless, sometimes homeless. However, this problem can be dealt with ==in a proper way==. The reason behind the difficulty finding another job for those physical workers is that they are in lack of precious specific skills, which was exactly the reason brought them into hard physical work at the first place. ==With proper support and retraining programs, affected workers can transit to new roles in the evolving job market. In that way==, the problem of unemployment can become less worrying.

Except that machines can be more efficient and cheaper than human workers, replacing humans with machines in hard physical work has more advantages. First of all, ==machines offer distinct advantages over humans in physically demanding tasks. They can work tirelessly and with precision, alleviating the strain and health risks associated with manual labor==. In this case, machines can be more ideal workers than humans. What's more, physically demanding jobs also imply the potential health risks involved. Nowadays, many physical workers are suffering from various diseases, plenty of them are caused by long-term repetitive working, like muscle strain and bone aging, ==which situation can be largely improved by employing machines instead==<u>(return to the topic!)</u>. Last but not least, thoughts and feelings, which are most significant components of humanity, can be easily destroyed by dull and repetitive physical working. Having seen many physical workers myself, I understand deeply how they struggle to avoid being unified by their jobs. Physical work, which drains human's passion and creativity, has a certain potential of depriving the dignity of being human from workers, which makes it quite reasonable to consider fulfilling these jobs using machines once there appears the opportunity.(<u>freeing humans from such arduous work allows them to pursue more fulfilling and intellectually stimulating roles, preserving their mental and emotional well-being. For the reason that people have the opportunity to pay attention to more interesting and appealing jobs, which spices up their lives.</u>)

In conclusion, despite the concern that workers might lose jobs due to the large scale adaptation of machine manufacture, by ==addressing== the concerns of unemployment and ==prioritizing workers' well-being==, societies can ==harness the potential of automation== for a more ==sustainable and prosperous future==.
