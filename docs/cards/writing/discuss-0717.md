Some people believe that robots are significant for the development of human in the future, while others argue that this invention can be dangerous and might lead to nagative consequences. In my opinion, although certain aspects of the current society may be hugely influenced by robots, it's still a positive development rather than a negative one.

Robots not only boost the productivity of the whole society but also lowers the cost of corresponding services. First and foremost, unlike human, robots as well as machines never get tired as long as enough energy is provided, which means they can work through day and night, needing not rest. This undoubtedly indicates a higher amount of production of robots comparing to their human counterparts. For example, the recently released auto-driving taxi service in China earned a wide positive feedbacks. The fact that robots never get tired eliminates the danger of driving in exhaustion, while that robots strictly follow the driving rules minimizes the trouble of violating the law. Furthermore, since large-scale service become possible, former high costs of certain services are likely to be lowered, which allows more population to find them affordable and definitely improves residents' quality of life.

However, as others might argue, there do exist some concerns about the emerging of robots. Firstly, it's forseeable that new technology, especially one which seems possible to replace human in some jobs, might cause a series of troubles in society during the period of transition. For instance, the auto-driving taxi service mentioned above received negative comments from taxi drivers as well, which aroused concerns about what impact this service would bring to the society if it causes widespread job loss for taxi drivers. Furthermore, if robot service become the new monopoly of a certain market, the lower prices people used to expect might not continue being true.

In conclusion, despite the concerns of large-scale robot involved service, I believe the advantages of this new trend worth the risk. Although jobs might be lost during this change, I believe more vacancies will be created as well, just as history events like Industrial Revolution once showed us. In terms of the concern of service prices, I believe market reactions will ensure that consumers get the benefit.
