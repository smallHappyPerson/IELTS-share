Some people argue that some specific old buildings are worthier to be preserved than others. From my perspective, those which present typical features of local architectures in certain historical periods worth more efforts than others. I also agree that the positive impacts of preserving old buildings outweigh the negative ones.

Since the most precious aspect of old buildings is their historical values, I believe buildings which have more features in detail within a specific historical period are more treasurable than others. To begin with, those buildings preserve rich details of the local culture as well as the wisdom of old-time builders. By presenting all those marvelous achievements, they allow new generations to take a glance at the lifestyle of past days. For example, in Suzhou, China, local government made great efforts to preserve their southern style old buildings with the typical white walls and dark roofs. Until today, millions of tourists went Suzhou just to appreciate the landscape and they still get obsessed with the old poetic lifestyle of people once lived there when they see the buildings. In this case, by preserving old-buildings, local government not only maintained their unique architectures, which serves as a significant part of the local culture, but also promoted tourism.

I also believe that the advantages of preserving old buildings weigh far more than the disadvantages. It might be argued that in a situation where serious issues like education and crime are waiting to be tackled, spending government budgets on old architecture preservation seems luxurious. However, in my opinion, the urgency of preserving old buildings are just as significant as other issues. First and foremost, the lifespan of old buildings has to be considered. Unlike other problems, once a precious architecture, which owns considerable value of research and has a potential to preserve local culture, is destroyed due to natural aging, nothing can be done to amend that. And the treasure of it fades away forever. What's more, just as the practice in Suzhou mentioned above, preservation of old buildings is not merely a money-consuming project. It also has the potential to pay back in other ways like tourism income. And their values in terms of culture are beyond saying.

In conclusion, I believe old architectures which contains huge details of old days deserve to be preserved for its values in a cultural meaning. And the practice of preserving is not only urgent due to the expectancy of a building, but also has the potential to bring back financial benefits.
