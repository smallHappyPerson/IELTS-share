Some people prefer to provide help and support directly to those in their local community who need it. Others,however prefer to give money to national and international charitable organizations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

---
People's perceptions differ in terms of the approach to provide help for those in need. Some believe that offering direct help for people in local community suits them better, while others prefer to donate money to public charitable agencies. Personally, I believe that both these approaches are reasonable and with hybrid types of help people in need can finally get adequate care.

Supporting people who struggles within the local communities can be favorable not only for a probably more harmonious community relationship but also for the liability of information source. First of all, people living in the same community are closely connected. Even without knowing each other, residents are likely to have met each other for several times, the sense of connection resulted from which would boost people's sympathy when seeing neighbers in pain and motivate them to help. Meanwhile, this familiarity also guarantees the credibility of the information source of others' suffering because a visit to them could do the verification, thus ensuring that supports go towards people who are truly in need. What's more, the fact that people offering help can have access to those who's receiving it also make help-givers better informed of the details and the process, which allows them to provide more targeted content of support. Lastly, offering help to fellow local residents also contributes to the construction of a more peaceful and kind community which in return benefits helpers themselves.

However, although there exists a risk of deception and credibility abuse, national and international charitable organizations are capable to do more benefits to the global world which can't be done by helping only community members. Those organizations care for people from a much larger range of area, sometimes worldwide. Since people residing in the same community have more probability to share the same level of life, life of a man living in suburban of London and that of a young girl in Iran can be extremely different. Even this man suffers from way more financial deficiency than his neighbers, it's no doubt that the girl deserves more support. However, at the same time, this is exactly the greatest drawback of organization-dominant charity. Considering that organizations sometimes would make up stories to appeal donation, this little girl might not even exist, which highlights the importance of adopting careful examination for donors while attempting to giving out their own earnings.

In conclusion, offering support for other community residents guarantees a close communication and connection between both sides which ensures that the help-receivers deserve the care and that the help-givers are able to provide proper help based on the detailed occasion. Meanwhile, charitable organizations offers an opportunity to provide help in a worldwide area, with a disadvantagement that donors would have no chance to meet the donation-receiver face by face and fall for the storytelling conspiracies those agencies present. From my perspective, with both channels in place, those who need help can finally get sufficient support.

> Supporting people who struggle within the local community can lead to more harmonious relationships and ensure **reliable** information sources. First, frequent interactions among community members foster a sense of connection, which boosts sympathy and motivates residents to help when they see neighbors in need. For example, a study by XYZ University found that communities with strong
> local support networks reported higher levels of overall well-being. This familiarity also ensures the **credibility** of **information about others' suffering**, as personal visits can verify needs, making sure support goes to those truly in need. **Additionally**, direct access to those receiving help allows givers to be better informed about the details and process, enabling them to provide more targeted support. Lastly, helping local residents contributes to a more peaceful and kind community, which **in turn** benefits the helpers themselves. For instance, community volunteer programs often report increased satisfaction and mental health among participants. 

However, although there exists a risk of deception and credibility abuse, national and international charitable organizations are capable to do(==of== providing) more benefits to the global world which can't be done by helping only community members. Those organizations care for people from a much larger range of areas, sometimes worldwide. Since people residing in the same community have more probability to share the same level of life, the life of a man living in suburban ~~==of==~~ London and that of a young girl in lran can be extremely different.
