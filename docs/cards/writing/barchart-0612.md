The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the global population in four countries during 1950 and 2002, as well as the predictions to 2050.

The percentage of global population in China remains the top from 1950 to 2002 regardless of its drop, while that of India experienced a sharp rise. Except for India, all the other 3 countries, China, the USA and Japan, have seen a decrease in the population proportion. According to the projections provided, India would take over the top place of China on this figure by 2050.

In 1950, China took the largest percentage of global population, with a figure of around 26%, which exceeded the sum of that of the second place, India(15%), and the third place, the USA(10%). Meanwhile, Japan ranked lowest in these four countries, with a figure of 5%. From 1905 to 2002, this figure of China experienced a slight drop, from 26% to 24%, while that is also the case in the USA and Japan, whose figures dropped to 8% and 4% respectively. In contrast, the proportion of global population in India saw a sharp rise of 4%, reaching 19%.

Although by 2002, it seems that India is not likely to take over China on the worldwide population proportion figure considering the gap of 5% between them, according to the projections, China's figure is expected to go through a fall of about 5%, dropping to exactly the level of India in 2002. However, that figure of India has a tendency to grow by about 2%, highlighting India's potential to be the top ranking country in this terms. Aside from China, the figure of the USA is expected to remain stable during 2002 and 2050, while that of Japan would experience a consistent drop of another 1%.
