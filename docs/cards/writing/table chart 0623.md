The table compares the change of the population in 4 areas in 1950 and 2000, as well as the projections in 2050.

The population in Australia and North America witnessed a considerable increase from 1950 to 2000, while that in Europe and Japan experienced merely a slight rise. Comparing to the figures in 2000, by 2050, the population in Europe and in Japan are expected to go through a drop, while that in the other two areas continue rising.

From 1950 to 2000, Australia saw the most significant increase in terms of population among the 4 areas, from 8.2 million to 19.1 million, with an average annual increase rate of 1.7%. North America also saw a considerable rise in population with an increase rate of 1.2%, reaching 314.3 million. In contrast, population in Europe and Japan merely witnessed a humble rise with an increase rate of 0.5% and 0.8% per year respectively.

According to the projections, by 2050, the population in Australia would have rised to 25.2 million, with an average annual increase rate of 0.6% starting from 1950. The population in North American are also predicted to continue rising on the basis of 2000, with an increase rate of 0.6% in total, reaching the final figure of 417.8 million in 2050. However, both the population in Europe and Japan are expected to experience a drop from 2000(Japan 127.5 million, Europe 450.6 million) to 2050(Japan 98 million, Europe 379.2 million), leaving the increase rate of these 2 areas during a 100-year-span only 0.3% and 0.5% respectively.
