The first chart below shows how energy is used in an average Australian household. The second chart shows the greenhouse gas emissions which result from this energy use.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

The pie charts show the proportion of energy use purposes in an Australian household at an average level and that of the amount of greenhouse gas generated due to the energy use respectively.

Australian families use their energy mostly on heating and hardly on cooling. However, the greenhouse gas emissions caused by water heating has taken the biggest proportion when it comes to environmental concerns.

First of all, Heating seems to be a considerable demand in Australian since the energy goes to heating takes up to 42% of all the energy expenditure. However, house heating alone does not produce too much greenhouse gas possibly thanks to those environmental-friendly approaches to provide heating adopted. On the contrary, energy used for cooling takes only a tiny part of the sum and almost does not result in greenhouse gas release, too.

Meanwhile, water heating is not only counted as the second most consumption of energy, up to 32%, but also contributed to the most greenhouse gas emissions which is 32%. Just the same, energy used for refrigeration, lighting, appliances also see a sharp difference between the proportion of energy consumption and production of greenhouse gas. These objects, which does not make a big part in energy using, does generated more greenhouse gases from energy use.

**It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.**

It's been argued that punishment is necessary to help children understand the distinction between right and wrong in the early stage of their personality development. I agree that reasonable punishment can play a role in avoiding children behaving wrong repeatedly, but necessary boundaries should be set between reasonable punishemnt and unreasonable ones.

There're several reasons which make me approve the necessity of punishment. To begin with, children can be quite naughty and annoying sometimes, which has been complained much by people who suffered from them, including parents, teachers, even passengers once sat beside a crying child. And with some built-in animal nature, children may not accept necessary guidance and discipline until adults show the cold face. What's more, punishment has been proved useful by scientists who used electricity to punish rats which guided their way out of a maze. Cruel as it may sounds like, slight punishment can achieve things which encouragement can't.

However, punishment should be confined in an approppriate area. First of all, power without restriction has a tendency to lead to abusement, which means if parents or teachers use punishment without boundaries, their supposedly good will can result in pure bullying. For example, phyical punishment to children should undoubtly be forbidden by the law. Second, for that they are new to the society, children always have trouble fitting in social rules or catching up school works, which is fairly understandable. Instead of rage and unreasonable punishment, adults with responsiblity should show more patience when raising a child. Last but not least, punishment is not the only way to achieve the purpose of giving education. Different approaches should be applied when helping children behave better.

To conclude, I think proper punishment can be used as a tool during education, but the extent to which punishment can reach should be considered carefully.
