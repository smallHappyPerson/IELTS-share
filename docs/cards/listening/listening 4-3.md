1. 8/10
	- that's because I don't have room to take notes! ok, I missed and I don't have a big brain memory
	- I dont know what a `twin room` is. And that means bedrooms intentionally designed for 2 people living together, always includes twin beds, and the beds will be smaller(omg just as my room in company dormitary) , and twin room is very economic for *lovers* or *siblings* or *friends*, not double room, in which case the bed will be larger and will be suitable for couples
2. 7/10
	- I should have use upper case for both words
	- I don't know why I can't write `whole family` without the `the`
	- I'm sorry I missed the `s` in the gardens

	- about 2000 and I wrote 2000 sumimasen
	- what does `halls of residence` means? I ended up with house..
	- don't think it is my fault but maybe I should pay more attention to forming a phrase that makes sense
	- sorry i don't think I need to write the facilities down.
