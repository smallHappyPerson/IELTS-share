1. 8/10
	1. Who knows `College Dining Room` needs upper case beginning!
	2. I heard `office staff` and wrote `office staffs` and thought I was cautious! staff是单复数同形。意思是全体职工(或雇员)。staff用以指“工作人员”的总称时，是集合名词，不用复数。（可以用staffs表示工作人员，但没有staff常用）
2. 9/10
	1. I chose "local guides", but `work in local area` does not mean they are local people! and I missed the key sentence
3. 8/10
	1. the key was `units of measurement` and all I heard was `measurement`, in fact if I wrote `measurements` it can be right.
	2. I chose an invalid answer. and she said `great equipment` not `too much!`
4. 8/10
	1. answer is `tail` and I heard `tail` and I wrote `tail` at the first place but I added an `s` to it cleverly......smile. Maybe that is rational cause one shark has only 1 tail
	2. I thought it was New Zealand so I did not listen to them following... which mentioned South Africa
	3. **I noticed the `hot season`, `Nov` is summer in South semi-sphere!**
