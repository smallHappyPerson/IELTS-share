1. 7/10
   1. The question here is about the type of transportation and I heard the word `minibus` so I wrote `minibus`, but the turn out the answer should be `by minibus` or a `minibus`. Confusing.
   2. First of all, I mistook the number 280 as 290. And then I was too clever so that I multiplied the number I heard with 2, which is mentioned by the man to be the number of people attending this trip. that is not necessary because it says the tour......1 tour.....
   3. My brain was wandering. I didn't understand that t`he customers reference number` should be given by the staff not the customer. So I was waiting for the voice of the customer. So I missed. This is about my listening issue that I cannot focus on what people is talking about.
2. 9/10
   1. the answer was `brakes` and ok I heard but I wrote `breaks`, Sorry for not recognizing the word brake(刹车)
3. 5/10
   1. It was a total disaster that I failed part-2 totally. this is because my start point was chosen wrongly. when I first heard the sentences I thought it was not the answer. So I wait until the audio suddenly finished. I was shocked that I mean I was expecting more. But actually it turns out the answers given are really reasonable...
4. 7/10
   1. `early twenties` I firstly wrote this. But then my damn input program suggest `twentieth` which made me wrong.
   2. missed
   3. missed
