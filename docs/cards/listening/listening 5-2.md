   2. missed number
   3. I wrote 1.50 and typed `1.5`...
   4. I don't realize that `you can book the computer up to ... in advance` means I should focus on the latest choice(which I failed, too), but it was about the earliest time point that I can book
2. 6/10
   1. decide the answer too early and skipped the following word. I guess it's because I think listening is tiring
   2. missed
   3. missed number cause I was waiting and I was not listening why cannot I focus!
   4. `contact voluntary staff of our office` does not means contact some volunteers for us!!! this means the staff in our office is voluntary!
3. 9/10
