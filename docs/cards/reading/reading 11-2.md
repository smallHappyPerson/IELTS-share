  - 这题太抽象了，and I thought it was not about _abstract art only_? I saw representional art mentioned so although that choice was absurd, too, I chose it. maybe because I'm tired of thinking so I gave up...Or it should be clear that shouldn't have chosen that title with representational art in it... Because it does not fit into the group.. sumimasen. So turns out the purpose of bringing up the topic of representational art _is to compare_ with abstract art... and dispute a commonly mistaken thing.
