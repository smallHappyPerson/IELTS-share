1. 12/13
	- I read too slow or I chose the bad sequence to answer the questions so I did not look through so it's hard for me to know this sentence is built up and not mentioned in the passage
2. 12/13
	- I don't know complaints means disease, and I missed the key. `chronic illness == long-term complaints`
3. 13/14
	- I forgot that `xxx which` can be a word used to be limitive. So that will limit the topic to `mental activities which is improved` and improve here is a key word
