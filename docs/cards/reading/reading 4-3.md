==2024-05-01== **7.0**

1. 9/13
	- referring to other people's sentences can be an example, but not a highlight which is expressed by the author
	- missed and did not think twice
	- missed
	- This Information was not given in the article, but I chose `false`, But in this case, I should have chosen `not given`.
2. 10/13
	- missed key sentence I was too obsessed on the skills introduced by Simon that the questions in IELTS reading test are often organized in sequence, but in this case it's not. so I missed the key phrases. it's because I was desperate for reading faster so I didn't read the whole article which leads to the missing of the key word.
	- misunderstood what I read so missed key word. I was in a hurry which I didn't understand why. I misunderstood the phrase. I thought `Karoo` and `South Africa` was 2 different places which caused me thinking `Karoo` might be the answer but the real answer is behind the whole sentence I was focusing on.
	- tricky one.  I think this kind of fillings are those I will never figure out how to do it right. Cause I cannot predict what the examiner is thinking while she making up the questions. I wrote `gas trapped inside`  Which is fault in the first place because I didn't use `gases`,  But even if I did make it right, how can I know that the real answer might be `gases` or `trapped gases`. I mean what's the difference between those and my answer.
3. 11/14
	-  I read this sentence, but I forgot it when it comes to this question.
	-  I don't know why I can't use `cameras` instead of `camera`.
	-  Ironically, it's obvious that the answer I gave out was nonsense. I think I didn't check it twice and I saw the key word but I did not saw the importance..
