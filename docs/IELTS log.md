| 听力  | 阅读  | 写作  | 口语  | 总成绩 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8.5 | 9.0 | 6.5 | 7.0 | 8.0 |
- exam: 
	- failed at **writing** part, with 40 min spent on part1 and only 20 min on part2, my part2 was like shit. However, 6.5 is surprise for me. I thought it might have been lower than 6...
	- **speaking** normal, can be better.
	- **listen** and **reading** normal

- I think my listening score can be above ==8== and my reading score can be above ==8==. 
- **speaking** is much better now, I really have to talk to real people. especially arguing!
- still need to read for **writing**. writing makes me nervous

# 2024-05-29
- After a month doing **listening** and **reading** exercises, I think my listening score can be above 7.5 and my reading score can be above 8. If I don't make big mistakes on listening I can get 8, too. If I do well on reading , I can get 8.5
- **speaking** can be a problem, but I can keep talking to Annie and keep watching British TV shows.
- I think the important part of **writing** is to *read* lots of example articles and imitate them. So read a lot and write a lot, but purposely.

## What am I planning on
- ***listening***: 
	- doing real questions **daily** *40min*; 
	- continue doing that real exercises on bilibili **daily** *30min*;
- ***speaking***: 
	- keep giving lessons **weekly** *90min*; (use English more and practice) 
	- give Annie real questions  and do exercises and go through what I have said; 
	- must use English when sending weibo **daily**
- ***reading***: do real questions **daily** *70min*
- ***writing***: *==I don't know==*
- exam skills: 
	- do whole real paper on weekend **weekly** *180min*
	- review Simon's notes when relevant parts involved

> I have to admit that planning on my own and actually implement that plan is so hard. I have never made such complex, large and long-term plan before in my 22-year life. When I was in my high school, all I have was some general pictures and casual enforcement of the plan. In my uni, I might once made some plan, but that was like: the exam is 2 days later, I should finish the first half of the slides today ans the rest tomorrow. Basically, being chased by deadlines.(and magically I started to run! as magical as how I learned to ride a bicycle)
> 
> I was one of those kind of people who will not achieve anything without someone else pushing from behind. For example, I don't clean too much, but I have a maximum of tolerance, once I cannot stand up with that room any more, I will clean it including every visible corner. In this case, the extent to which my room is a mess played the role of the one who pushes me. (maybe that's why I got `P` in MBTI...) I have to say, looking through my life, my attitude is more like "I want this, but I am too lazy to actually devote much effort to this, so let's make casual efforts and see what will happen then."

> And I should definitely thank my high school teachers who had made plans for me and forced me to do them. But should I? Could they be the ones to blame for my lack of ability to follow a self-made plan? But maybe that is mostly a problem of mine.
## What have I done by far
- **finished** Simon's lessons and have taken notes, haven't reviewed or gone through yet
	- this helps
- ***reading***: have been going through some IELTS vocabs recently
	- also helps
- ***listening***: have been doing some listening exercises recently on bilibili
	- not bad
- ***speaking***: have been giving chemistry lessons to a girl on chemistry lately; once talked to annie
	- I really should use more English!
