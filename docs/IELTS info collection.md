# 剑雅真题做题指南

> 剑1~3，基本不考  
- 剑4-6，初期用来熟悉题型、难度、要求等，找出薄弱，针对性训练。  
- 剑7-9，单篇模拟夯实基础，进一步熟悉模拟考试
- 剑10-12，严格按照时间来训练做题的速度以及锻炼做题技巧
- 剑13-15，用于考前一两个月的模拟，查漏补缺。  
- 剑16-17，是参考意义最大的两本，因此，可以用来考前模拟。17难度稍高
- 剑18，整体的阅读难度难度加大，出现了词库型填空题🔎，判断题的占比也整体下降📈LOH题型回归~

	- IELTS test is not about understand, they don't need you to understand, you need to watch carefully to find which choice seems to be ==transformed== from the given article.
	- The test will have ==a fixed proportion of vocabularies that you don't know.== Its purpose is to increase the difficulty, not to make you remember them all.
	- ==Listening== is like a waterfall, words flood in, you don't need to collect them all, you just need to locate the ==words with importance==
	- Listening to lessons is like searching for a needle in the sea. You just need to focus on your ==own deficiency.==
	- Don't try to remember too much vocabularies, those knowledge does not belong to you, and faking it can overwhelm you.
