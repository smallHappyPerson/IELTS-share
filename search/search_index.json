I have never made such complex, large and long-term plan before in my 22-year life. When I was in my high school, all I have was some general pictures and casual enforcement of the plan. In my uni, I might once made some plan, but that was like: the exam is 2 days later, I should finish the first half of the slides today ans the rest tomorrow. Basically, being chased by deadlines.(and magically I started to run! as magical as how I learned to ride a bicycle)</p> <p>I was one of those kind of people who will not achieve anything without someone else pushing from behind. For example, I don't clean too much, but I have a maximum of tolerance, once I cannot stand up with that room any more, I will clean it including every visible corner. In this case, the extent to which my room is a mess played the role of the one who pushes me. (maybe that's why I got <code>P</code> in MBTI...) I have to say, looking through my life, my attitude is more like \"I want this, but I am too lazy to actually devote much effort to this, so let's make casual efforts and see what will happen then.\"</p> <p>And I should definitely thank my high school teachers who had made plans for me and forced me to do them. But should I? Could they be the ones to blame for my lack of ability to follow a self-made plan? But maybe that is mostly a problem of mine.</p>"},{"location":"IELTS%20log/#what-have-i-done-so-far","title":"What have I done so far","text":"<ul> <li>finished Simon's lessons and have taken notes, haven't reviewed or gone through yet<ul> <li>this helps</li> </ul> </li> <li>reading: have been going through some IELTS vocabs recently<ul> <li>also helps</li> </ul> </li> <li>listening: have been doing some listening exercises recently on bilibili<ul> <li>not bad</li> </ul> </li> <li>speaking: have been giving chemistry lessons to a girl on chemistry lately; once talked to annie<ul> <li>I really should use more English!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"vocab/","title":"Vocab","text":"<p>celebrated romance novelist \u8457\u540d\u7684 \u6d6a\u6f2b\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5bb6</p> <p>town square \u57ce\u9547\u5e7f\u573a</p> <p>plaque \u533e\u724c</p> <p>commemorate</p> <p>gravestone</p> <p>runner-up \u4e9a\u519b</p> <p>roundabout \u8fc2\u56de\u7684</p> <p>acclaimed \u5e7f\u53d7\u597d\u8bc4</p> <p>apparitions of monks \u50e7\u4fa3\u7684\u5e7b\u5f71</p> <p>believer</p> <p>a film is shot beautifully</p> <p>convent school \u4fee\u9053\u9662 school</p> <p>comic book</p> <p>university hall of residence \u5927\u5b66\u5bbf\u820d</p> <p>virtually \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a</p> <p>extended family - go beyond nuclear family which is only consisted of parents and a child, this contains other relatives</p> <p>benifit from family line like family tree, refers to the ancestral lineage which connects individuals through parents, grand parents...</p> <p>Victorian servant \u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u65f6\u671f\uff0c1837\uff0d1901 - maids(clean laundry), cook, butler, housekeeper, governess(educate children, especially the daughters of the family, in the case of upper class)nanny, footman(assist with formal duties, like open doors, carrying luggage) -  Victorian servants were typically part of the hierarchical system known as domestic service.</p> <p>stable hands \u9a6c\u592b\uff1f -  Also known as grooms, a crucial part of the working culture in the past, particularly in horse-dominant industries, especially in the victorian era.

Do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>After being put into prisons, many people who once committed crimes have realized and reconsidered their former misdeeds and became nice citizens later. I totally agree that they would be great teachers on educating teenagers about how close ordinary people can be to committing a crime.</p> <p>On the one hand, those who truely realized their former mistakes have deeper understanding of how a crime would happen, which helps students be alerted when they encounter a crime or on the edge of committing a crime. Many crimes are not necessarily out of personal malice. Under most circumstances, people don't even realize until the terrible consequence is made. For example, a person controlled by alchohol might severely hurt others unconciously. However, if the prison life, which takes the guilty away from addicts, makes the person regret and be determined to change by bringing consiousness back to him, this person can definitely become a good citizen afterwards. Furthermore, some people, due to the absence of education and parenting, may have no concepts of the law, which makes them liable to touch the red line of the law. By clarifying the possible reasons behind unintended crimes, these people can explain how close normal person can be to crimes and promote students' awareness of law systems.</p> <p>On the other hand, people like them also show the successful operation of the current law system which strengthens adolescents' belief in the society and the possibility of starting a new life after a crime as long as this person has gone through the punishment he or she deserved. Since teenager-committed crimes are increasingly a concerned issue, this could be especially meaningful for young students who might accidentally have done something terrible and become too scared to request help due to a lack of relevant knowledge. However, trying to keep crimes a secret can only lead to more tragic consequences by attempts to cover, even having the potential of ruining a young person's personality. After being informed of the law system and developing faith in their future life, it's more likely for teenagers to reach out for help when something bad happens.</p> <p>In conclusion, it's a brilliant idea to educate students about laws and crimes through speeches given by former prisoners. Not only do they understand deeply how crimes happen, but they themselves can also function as a showcase of modern law systems and reveal the possiblity of being a new person towards teenagers who have already gone through tough situations.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/agree%20or%20disagree%200713/#review","title":"review","text":"<ul> <li>unconsciously</li> <li>instructors</li> <li>truly</li> <li>how crimes occur</li> <li>stay alert when they encounter or are on the verge of commiting a crime</li> <li>their belief in the rehabilitation after serving their punishment</li> <li>on the contrary</li> <li>conceal</li> <li>as efforts to hide the truth may ultimately</li> <li>legal system</li> <li>foster a belief</li> <li>future prospects</li> <li>additionally</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cards/writing/agree-0720/","title":"Agree 0720","text":"<p>[!question] It is important for everyone, including young people, to save money fortheir future. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</p> <p>Many people believe that it is significant for everyone to save money for their future life, including young people. I personally agree with this idea. However, I believe people's choices in terms of money saving might depend more on local policies.</p> <p>People need to save money not only for possible accidents in future, but also for the financial freedom they would like to have when it comes to shopping or investment. First and foremost, bad luck could happen to anyone. Unexpected issues such as car accidents and diseases are likely to destroy people's lives if they lack the economic ability to pay for the medical bills, which makes money saving a wise choice. Furthermore, except for accidents, people's necessary expenditure also entails large amount of money which requires a long-time accumulation for ordinary employees. For instance, without a certain amount of savings, people would be unable to buy a house or a car, while specific properties are required if they consider applying for a loan from banks. Also, personal plans such as travelling abroad are likely to be canceled due to a limited budget.</p> <p>However, these needs mentioned above might be less urgent in some specific societies where policies guarantee a basic lifestyle without a rigorous money saving strategy. For example, in mainland of China, employees are required to pay not only for taxes but also for obligated social insurances and medical insurances, which means when accidents happen, citizens can count on governments fundings other than their own savings. Meanwhile, in HongKong, China, citizens don't have to pay mandatory insurances, which seemingly increased their income. However, when accidents happen, residents need to rely more on their own money, which leads to the fact that many HK citizens decide to buy insurances themselves.</p> <p>In conclusion, I agree that people should have a money saving plan to prepare for future issues. But I also agree that with relevant policies in place, money saving may not be that important for some citizens.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/agree-0720/#review","title":"review","text":"<p>It_is_important_for_everyone,...By_ielts9.me.pdf</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/bar-0715/","title":"Bar 0715","text":"<p> The bar chart illustrates the changes in the locations where people from the UK used to browse webpages in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004.</p> <p>During the 6-year span, British citizens visit the Internet mostly from home.

Others,however prefer to give money to national and international charitable organizations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p> <p>People's perceptions differ in terms of the approach to provide help for those in need. Some believe that offering direct help for people in local community suits them better, while others prefer to donate money to public charitable agencies. Personally, I believe that both these approaches are reasonable and with hybrid types of help people in need can finally get adequate care.</p> <p>Supporting people who struggles within the local communities can be favorable not only for a probably more harmonious community relationship but also for the liability of information source. First of all, people living in the same community are closely connected. Even without knowing each other, residents are likely to have met each other for several times, the sense of connection resulted from which would boost people's sympathy when seeing neighbers in pain and motivate them to help. Meanwhile, this familiarity also guarantees the credibility of the information source of others' suffering because a visit to them could do the verification, thus ensuring that supports go towards people who are truly in need. What's more, the fact that people offering help can have access to those who's receiving it also make help-givers better informed of the details and the process, which allows them to provide more targeted content of support. Lastly, offering help to fellow local residents also contributes to the construction of a more peaceful and kind community which in return benefits helpers themselves.</p> <p>However, although there exists a risk of deception and credibility abuse, national and international charitable organizations are capable to do more benefits to the global world which can't be done by helping only community members. Those organizations care for people from a much larger range of area, sometimes worldwide. Since people residing in the same community have more probability to share the same level of life, life of a man living in suburban of London and that of a young girl in Iran can be extremely different. Even this man suffers from way more financial deficiency than his neighbers, it's no doubt that the girl deserves more support.

First, frequent interactions among community members foster a sense of connection, which boosts sympathy and motivates residents to help when they see neighbors in need. For example, a study by XYZ University found that communities with strong local support networks reported higher levels of overall well-being. This familiarity also ensures the credibility of information about others' suffering, as personal visits can verify needs, making sure support goes to those truly in need. Additionally, direct access to those receiving help allows givers to be better informed about the details and process, enabling them to provide more targeted support. Lastly, helping local residents contributes to a more peaceful and kind community, which in turn benefits the helpers themselves. For instance, community volunteer programs often report increased satisfaction and mental health among participants. </p> <p>However, although there exists a risk of deception and credibility abuse, national and international charitable organizations are capable to do(of providing) more benefits to the global world which can't be done by helping only community members. Those organizations care for people from a much larger range of areas, sometimes worldwide. Since people residing in the same community have more probability to share the same level of life, the life of a man living in suburban of London and that of a young girl in lran can be extremely different. Even though this man suffers from way more financial deficiency(difficulties) than his neighbers(neighbors), it's no doubt that the girl deserves more support. However, at the same time, this is exactly the greatest drawback of organization-dominant charity.

In my opinion, although certain aspects of the current society may be hugely influenced by robots, it's still a positive development rather than a negative one.</p> <p>Robots not only boost the productivity of the whole society but also lowers the cost of corresponding services. First and foremost, unlike human, robots as well as machines never get tired as long as enough energy is provided, which means they can work through day and night, needing not rest. This undoubtedly indicates a higher amount of production of robots comparing to their human counterparts. For example, the recently released auto-driving taxi service in China earned a wide positive feedbacks. The fact that robots never get tired eliminates the danger of driving in exhaustion, while that robots strictly follow the driving rules minimizes the trouble of violating the law. Furthermore, since large-scale service become possible, former high costs of certain services are likely to be lowered, which allows more population to find them affordable and definitely improves residents' quality of life.</p> <p>However, as others might argue, there do exist some concerns about the emerging of robots. Firstly, it's forseeable that new technology, especially one which seems possible to replace human in some jobs, might cause a series of troubles in society during the period of transition. For instance, the auto-driving taxi service mentioned above received negative comments from taxi drivers as well, which aroused concerns about what impact this service would bring to the society if it causes widespread job loss for taxi drivers. Furthermore, if robot service become the new monopoly of a certain market, the lower prices people used to expect might not continue being true.</p> <p>In conclusion, despite the concerns of large-scale robot involved service, I believe the advantages of this new trend worth the risk. Although jobs might be lost during this change, I believe more vacancies will be created as well, just as history events like Industrial Revolution once showed us. In terms of the concern of service prices, I believe market reactions will ensure that consumers get the benefit.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/flow%200626/","title":"Flow 0626","text":"<p>The diagram provides a description for the construction of a simple water filter and the way in which this filter produces drinkable clean water.</p> <p>The main composition of this water filter can be divided into 6 parts.

From my perspective, those which present typical features of local architectures in certain historical periods worth more efforts than others. I also agree that the positive impacts of preserving old buildings outweigh the negative ones.</p> <p>Since the most precious aspect of old buildings is their historical values, I believe buildings which have more features in detail within a specific historical period are more treasurable than others. To begin with, those buildings preserve rich details of the local culture as well as the wisdom of old-time builders. By presenting all those marvelous achievements, they allow new generations to take a glance at the lifestyle of past days. For example, in Suzhou, China, local government made great efforts to preserve their southern style old buildings with the typical white walls and dark roofs. Until today, millions of tourists went Suzhou just to appreciate the landscape and they still get obsessed with the old poetic lifestyle of people once lived there when they see the buildings. In this case, by preserving old-buildings, local government not only maintained their unique architectures, which serves as a significant part of the local culture, but also promoted tourism.</p> <p>I also believe that the advantages of preserving old buildings weigh far more than the disadvantages. It might be argued that in a situation where serious issues like education and crime are waiting to be tackled, spending government budgets on old architecture preservation seems luxurious. However, in my opinion, the urgency of preserving old buildings are just as significant as other issues. First and foremost, the lifespan of old buildings has to be considered. Unlike other problems, once a precious architecture, which owns considerable value of research and has a potential to preserve local culture, is destroyed due to natural aging, nothing can be done to amend that. And the treasure of it fades away forever. What's more, just as the practice in Suzhou mentioned above, preservation of old buildings is not merely a money-consuming project. It also has the potential to pay back in other ways like tourism income. And their values in terms of culture are beyond saying.</p> <p>In conclusion, I believe old architectures which contains huge details of old days deserve to be preserved for its values in a cultural meaning. And the practice of preserving is not only urgent due to the expectancy of a building, but also has the potential to bring back financial benefits.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/mixed-0715/#review","title":"review","text":"<ul> <li>more worthy</li> <li>be enchanted by the old poetic lifestyle once prevalent there</li> <li>while some might argue</li> <li>moerover, furthermore, additionally</li> <li>there value is beyond measure</li> <li> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cards/writing/mixed-0715/#value-in-a-cultural-sense","title":"value in a cultural sense","text":""},{"location":"cards/writing/mixed-0717/","title":"Mixed 0717","text":"<p>Nowadays, people from many countries prefer wearing western-style clothes such as suits and jeans in daily life rather than their traditional ones. The reasons behind are complex and I believe to some extent it's a negative trend.</p> <p>People's choices on clothes not only depend on the convenience of the object but also reflects the significant cultural influence western world has in modern time. First and foremost, western-style clothes such as shirts and jeans are widely adopted for that they are lighter and more convenient as daily clothes. For example, comparing to modern choices, traditional Chinese clothes are much more loose and complex and therefore less convenient for current fast-paced city life. Furthermore, this trend also shows the powerfulness of western world nowadays. Since western countries expanded widely across the globe several centuries ago, they have spreaded their own culture all over the world. Today, due to the advancement of their film industry, western-style life, including western food and western clothes, is popupar worldwide again.</p> <p>From my perspective, despite the convenience of modern western-style clothes, certain risks of the wide preference to it cannot be neglected. To begin with, a unified outlook, which indicates a increasingly similar inner cultural motivation, has a great potential to harm the world's diversity. One factor that makes earth interesting is the diversity coming from all those independently developed civilizations, presenting various types of lifestyles. As the trend of the clothes unification grows, many dressing traditions of minority cultures are at risk. For example, in China, many people have never tried traditional ethnical clothes through their lives, which lowers their sense of identity.</p> <p>In conclusion, people with different cultural backgrounds nowadays prefer western-style clothes for its convenience and a more advanced type of lifestyle it represents. However, I believe that if people don't pay attention to the preservation of their own dressing traditions, not only diversity of the civilization may be hurt, but people would also suffer from the loss of the sense of identity.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/outweigh%200612/","title":"Outweigh 0612","text":"<p>Nowadays, more and more jobs and task are done by machines which involve hard physical work. Do these effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?</p> <p>Increasing number of physically demanding jobs are being done by machines instead of human workers in modern society. From my perspective, this trend has more benefits than drawbacks.</p> <p>Admittedly, replacing human workers with machines in any areas can have disadvantages, among which the most concerned problem is unemployment caused directly by it. Usually, business owners would prefer machines for their efficiency and low price, which motivates them to fire their former employees in pursuit of machine-dominant manufacturing for long-term profit, leaving those employees jobless, sometimes homeless. However, this problem can be dealt with. The reason behind the difficulty finding another job for those physical workers is that they are in lack of precious specific skills, which was exactly the reason brought them into hard physical work at the first place. If proper help is given to them, such as skill lessons and interview coaching, the problem of unemployment can become less worrying.</p> <p>Except that machines can be more efficent and cheaper than human workers, replacing humans with machines in hard physical work has more advantages. First of all, human beings are animals, which means we have limits in physical term and only few humans can do excellent job while on the edge of physical limit. In this case, machines can be more ideal workers than humans. What's more, physical demanding jobs also implies the potential health risks involved. Nowadays, many physical workers are suffering from various diseases, plenty of them are caused by long-term repetitive working, like muscle strain and bone aging. Last but not least, one of the most significant component of humanity is that we have thoughts and feelings, which can be destroyed by dull physical working day by day. Having seen many physical workers myself, I understand deeply that they need to struggle to prevent themselves from being unified by their jobs. If physical work drain our passion and creativity, how can we still have the dignity of being human?</p> <p>In conclusion, despite the concern that workers might lose job due to the large scale adaption of machine manufacture, it's still a appealing future where machines do the hard physical jobs while human beings are free from dull and repetitive work and enjoy the creativity and innovation which belongs to them by nature.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/outweigh-0707/","title":"Outweigh 0707","text":"<p>Taking a gap year between high school and university to travel or work has become popular among young students nowadays.

The sales figure of adult's fictions, which once was the top of all 3 types back in 2002, was taken over by that of children's book and educational books respectively in 2003 and 2006, making itself the bottom in the end.</p> <p>In 2002, adult's fiction was the best-seller with a sales figure of 45 million dollars, while none of the figures of other two reached 35 million dollars. That situation changed, though, in 2003, when the sales earnings of children's books took over the top position of adult's fiction by an advantage of around 5 million dollars, and remained the top for the following 3 years during which its sales figure kept roaring and exceeded 55 million dollars in 2006. Meanwhile, the sales figure of adult's fictions saw a consistent decline through the 4 years, from 45 million dollars in 2002 to 30 million dollars in 2006, which included a slight rise of about 4 million dollars in 2004 but still failed to revert the falling trend.</p> <p>The sales number of educational book remained stable comparing to the other two types which both have a noticable trend. In 2002, 2004 and 2005, the sales figure of educational book was about 25 million dollars, which seems to be a common case. However, from 2005 to 2006, this number saw a rise of about 8 million dollars, which enabled educational books to rank the second place that formerly belonged to adult's fictions by a small gap of no more than 3 million dollars. For educational books, however, rise of this scale was once seen in 2003, when the number dropped back to basic line in the following year immediately.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/part2-outweigh-0612-note/","title":"Part2 outweigh 0612 note","text":"<ul> <li>original writing: outweigh 0612</li>

<p>Nowadays, more and more jobs and task are done by machines which involve hard physical work. Do these effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?</p> <p>Increasing number of physically demanding jobs are being done by machines instead of human workers in modern society. From my perspective, this trend has more benefits than drawbacks.</p> <p>Admittedly, replacing human workers with machines in any areas can have disadvantages, among which the most concerned problem is unemployment caused directly by it. Usually, business owners would prefer machines for their efficiency and low price, which motivates them to dismiss their former employees in pursuit of machine-dominant manufacturing for long-term profit, leaving those employees jobless, sometimes homeless. However, this problem can be dealt with in a proper way. The reason behind the difficulty finding another job for those physical workers is that they are in lack of precious specific skills, which was exactly the reason brought them into hard physical work at the first place. With proper support and retraining programs, affected workers can transit to new roles in the evolving job market. In that way, the problem of unemployment can become less worrying.</p> <p>Except that machines can be more efficient and cheaper than human workers, replacing humans with machines in hard physical work has more advantages. First of all, machines offer distinct advantages over humans in physically demanding tasks. They can work tirelessly and with precision, alleviating the strain and health risks associated with manual labor. In this case, machines can be more ideal workers than humans. What's more, physically demanding jobs also imply the potential health risks involved. Nowadays, many physical workers are suffering from various diseases, plenty of them are caused by long-term repetitive working, like muscle strain and bone aging, which situation can be largely improved by employing machines instead(return to the topic!). Last but not least, thoughts and feelings, which are most significant components of humanity, can be easily destroyed by dull and repetitive physical working. Having seen many physical workers myself, I understand deeply how they struggle to avoid being unified by their jobs. Physical work, which drains human's passion and creativity, has a certain potential of depriving the dignity of being human from workers, which makes it quite reasonable to consider fulfilling these jobs using machines once there appears the opportunity.(freeing humans from such arduous work allows them to pursue more fulfilling and intellectually stimulating roles, preserving their mental and emotional well-being. For the reason that people have the opportunity to pay attention to more interesting and appealing jobs, which spices up their lives.)</p> <p>In conclusion, despite the concern that workers might lose jobs due to the large scale adaptation of machine manufacture, by addressing the concerns of unemployment and prioritizing workers' well-being, societies can harness the potential of automation for a more sustainable and prosperous future.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/piechart-0621/","title":"Piechart 0621","text":"<p>[!QUESTION] The chart shows the percentage of time working adults spent the day on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. </p> <p>The pie chart compares the proportion of time spent by working adults during a day on various activities in 1958 and 2008 within one country.</p> <p>In both years, working adults spent the bulk of their days on working and sleeping.

Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.</p> <p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p> <p>What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?</p> <p>Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Write at least 250 words.</p> <p>It's been argued that punishment is necessary to help children understand the distinction between right and wrong in the early stage of their personality development. I agree that reasonable punishment can play a role in avoiding children behaving wrong repeatedly, but necessary boundaries should be set between reasonable punishemnt and unreasonable ones.</p> <p>There're several reasons which make me approve the necessity of punishment. To begin with, children can be quite naughty and annoying sometimes, which has been complained much by people who suffered from them, including parents, teachers, even passengers once sat beside a crying child. And with some built-in animal nature, children may not accept necessary guidance and discipline until adults show the cold face. What's more, punishment has been proved useful by scientists who used electricity to punish rats which guided their way out of a maze. Cruel as it may sounds like, slight punishment can achieve things which encouragement can't.</p> <p>However, punishment should be confined in an approppriate area. First of all, power without restriction has a tendency to lead to abusement, which means if parents or teachers use punishment without boundaries, their supposedly good will can result in pure bullying. For example, phyical punishment to children should undoubtly be forbidden by the law. Second, for that they are new to the society, children always have trouble fitting in social rules or catching up school works, which is fairly understandable. Instead of rage and unreasonable punishment, adults with responsiblity should show more patience when raising a child. Last but not least, punishment is not the only way to achieve the purpose of giving education. Different approaches should be applied when helping children behave better.</p> <p>To conclude, I think proper punishment can be used as a tool during education, but the extent to which punishment can reach should be considered carefully.</p>"},{"location":"cards/writing/writing%20example%20notes/","title":"1 7.1","text":""},{"location":"cards/writing/writing%20example%20notes/#11-film","title":"1.1 film","text":"<p>Many people prefer to watch foreign films than locally produced films.
